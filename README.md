# Tab-Keeper

## Working as an extension in Google Chrome, Tab Keeper provides two essential functions. The first is the ability to save all tabs currently open in a window. The second is the ability to open all these tabs at the click of a button. This dual functionality allows for the grouping of certain tabs related for a subject. For example, a group of tabs relating to a research project can all be saved and closed, but then all reopened at a later time with the click of one button.

### Utilizes Google Chrome Browser Action to easily create an accessible extension.
